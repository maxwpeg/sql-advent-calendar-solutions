-- Table Schema:
-- Table: elves
--   elf_id: INT
--   elf_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: vacations
--   elf_id: INT
--   start_date: DATE
--   return_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

select e.elf_name, coalesce(v.return_date, 'Still resting')
from elves e left join vacations v on e.elf_id=v.elf_id
ORDER by e.elf_name;
