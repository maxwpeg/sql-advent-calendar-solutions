-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

select subject,
  quiz_date,
  score,
  first_value(score) over (PARTITION by subject order by quiz_date) as fsrt,
  last_value(score) over (PARTITION by subject order by quiz_date range between UNBOUNDED PRECEDING and UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) as lst
from daily_quiz_scores
